## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hypermint operates a vulnerability disclosure program, inviting third party white hat security researchers to proactively test our products. If you are a security researcher and you believe that you have found a potential security issue in one of our assets, please report it using the form available in our [security page](https://moonpay.com/security).
